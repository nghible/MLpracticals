ML Practical Exercises

Some answers to the labs I have done in my M.Sc Data Science at King's College London.

## Lab 1: Machine Learning Metrics

## Lab 2: Linear Regression

## Lab 3: K-Means Clustering

## Lab 4: Naive Bayes & More K-Means

## Lab 5: Support Vector Machine

This lab is only theoretical and not practical.

## Lab 6: More Support Vector Machine

Practical implementation using scikit-learn. For a manual implementation from scartch, please look at the PacmanSVM repo.

## Lab 7: Neural Network for the Iris dataset. Backpropagation.

## Lab 8: Evolutionary Algoritms

## Lab 9: Reinforcement Learning

Bandit Learners for this lab. For the State-Action-Reward-State-Action implementation, please look at the PacmanSARSA repo.
